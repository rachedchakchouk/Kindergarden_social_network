Research shows that kindergarten improves children’s health and wellbeing, helps them to develop strong social skills and encourages a love of learning. Children who go to a kindergarten program are more independent and confident and are more likely to make a smooth transition to primary school (Prep). A high-quality kindergarten program will offer the child a range of learning experiences and activities that are both stimulating and fun. The child’s learning and curiosity will be encouraged   through experiences and activities, such as exploring the natural world, being exposed to new ideas and solving problems. Also, we should not forget about the important role of the parents in the development of the child, therefore they must supervise their child and his activities even when he is in the kindergarten.Also, we should not forget about the important role of the parents in the development of the child, therefore they must supervise their child and his activities even when he is in the kindergarten. As a conclusion, we strongly believe that both kindergartens and parents must co-work share responsibilities for the best of the children.
